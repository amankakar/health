# HideDiv

A super simple component to conditionally hide a div in React. The component accepts a bool as follows:

 ```javascript
 <HideDiv hide={false}><span>Hello world</span></HideDiv>
```

## Demo & Examples

To build the examples locally, run:

```
npm install
npm start
```

Then open [`localhost:8000`](http://localhost:8000) in a browser.


## Installation

The easiest way to use react-hide-div is to install it from NPM and include it in your own React build process (using [Browserify](http://browserify.org), [Webpack](http://webpack.github.io/), etc).

You can also use the standalone build by including `dist/react-hide-div.js` in your page. If you use this, make sure you have already included React, and it is available as a global variable.

```
npm install react-hide-div --save
```


## Usage

__EXPLAIN USAGE HERE__

```
import HideDiv from 'react-hide-div';

<HideDiv>Example</HideDiv>
```

Complete working example:

```javascript

import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import HideDiv from 'react-hide-div';

class App extends React.Component {
	constructor(props) {
		super(props);

		this.state = { hide: false };
		this.handleChange = this.handleChange.bind(this);
	}

	handleChange() {
		this.setState({hide: true});
	}

	render () {
		const styles = {
			width: "340px",
			padding: "6px",
			fontSize: "18px"
		};


		return (
			<div>
				<HideDiv hide={this.state.hide}>
					<input style={styles} onChange={this.handleChange} placeholder="Think you can enter text into this input?" />
				</HideDiv>
				<HideDiv hide>Hidden by default</HideDiv>
			</div>
		);
	}
}

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('app'));

```

## Development (`src`, `lib` and the build process)

**NOTE:** The source code for the component is in `src`. A transpiled CommonJS version (generated with Babel) is available in `lib` for use with node.js, browserify and webpack. A UMD bundle is also built to `dist`, which can be included without the need for any build system.

To build, watch and serve the examples (which will also watch the component source), run `npm start`. If you just want to watch changes to `src` and rebuild `lib`, run `npm run watch` (this is useful if you are working with `npm link`).
